      <t>Information Centric Networking (ICN) is a new paradigm where
      network communications are accomplished by requesting named content,
      instead of sending packets to destination addresses. This document
      provides an overview of the terminology and definitions that have been
      used in describing this new paradigm and currently covers the CCNx and NDN projects. This document is a product
      of the IRTF Information-Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG).</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>Information-centric networking (ICN) is an approach to evolve the
        Internet infrastructure from the existing host-centric design to
        a data-centric architecture where accessing data by name becomes the essential
        network primitive. The goal is to let applications refer to data independently of their location or means of
        transportation, which --for immutable data items-- enables native multicast delivery, ubiquitous
        in-network caching and replication of data objects.</t>

      <t>As the work on this topic continues to evolve, many new terms are
        born over time. The goal of this document is to provide a complete
        collection of these terms with a corresponding definition as they are
        used in the CCNx and NDN projects. Other, historic ICN projects like NetInf,
        XIA or Mobility First are not (yet) covered.</t>

<t>*** revision needed to explain that there exist multiple different flavors of ICN, and this draft focuses on NDN/CCN? </t>

      <t>To help provide the context of the individual terms to be defined, in this
        draft we first sketch the bigger picture of an ICN network, introducing
        the basic concepts and identifying the major components in the
        architecture in section 2 after which in section 3 ICN related terms
        are listed by different categories.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="architecture" title="A Sketch of the Big Picture of an ICN Network Architecture">

      <t>In networking terms an ICN is a delivery infrastructure for
      named data. A compatible distributed systems view is that
      an ICN is a distributed lookup service (!?!). The following list
      describes basic ICN concepts needed to discuss the
      implementation of this service abstraction:</t>

      <t>Request-Reply Protocol (Interest and Data Packet):</t>
        <t>An ICN's lookup service is implemented by defining two
        types of network packet formats: Interest packets that request
        content by name, and data packets that carry the requested
        content.  The returned data packet must match the request's
        parameters (e.g., having a partially or fully matching
        name). If the request is ambigious and several data packets
        would satisfy the request, the ICN network will typically
        return only one matching data packet.</t>

      <t>Packet and Content Names:</t>
        <t>Each data packet has one or more names by which its content
        can be referenced (!?!).  Without a irrefutable binding between a
        name of a data packet and its content, data packet names
        would be useless for fetching specific content. In ICN,
        verification of a data packet's name-to-content binding is achieved
        through cryptographic means, either by a
        cryptographic signature that explicitely binds an
        application-chosen name to a data packet's content, or relying on an implicit name (=cryptographic hash of the data packet) that the data consumer has obtained through a secure means.</t>
        
      <t>Data Authenticity and Encryption:</t>
        <t>Signatures carried in ICN packets enable applications and
        the network to validate the provenance of some ICN packet
        (=assert which key was used to sign). If a corresponding trust
        infrastructure (e.g., PKI) is in place, a packet's signature
        even enables to assess authenticity with relation to to real world
        identities. Whether a data packet's content (=payload) itself
        is encrypted or not is irrelevant for the ICN network: The use
        and the management of content encryption keys is fully in the
        hands of the application layer.
        <vspace blankLines="2"></vspace>
        </t>

      <t>Segmenting and Versioning:</t>
        <t>An ICN network will be engineered for some packet size
        limit. As application-level data objects will often be
        considerably larger, objects must be segmented into multiple
        data packets. The names for these data packets can, for
        example, be constructed by choosing one application-level
        object name to which a different suffix is added for each
        segment. The same method can be used to handle different
        versions of an application-level object by including a version
        number into the name of the overall object. Handling
        link-layer technologies which lead to even smaller
        fragmentation of ICN packets is done inside the ICN network
        and is not visible at the service interface.
        </t>

      <t>ICN Node:</t>
      <t>A node within an ICN network can fulfill the role of a data producer, a data consumer,
        and/or a forwarder for interest and data packets. When a forwarder has connectivity
        to neighbor nodes, it performs interest and data packet forwarding in real time. It can
        also behave like a packet mule, that is it may carry an interest or data packet over
        some distance before forwarding it to next node. An ICN node may also run routing
        protocols to assist its interest forwarding decisions.</t>

      <t>Stateful Forwarding Plane:</t>
      <t>The canonical way of implementing packet forwarding in an ICN network like CCNx and NDN
        relies on three data structures that capture a node's state: a Forwarding Interest
        Table (FIB), a Pending Interest Table (PIT), and a Content Store (CS). It also utilizes
        interest forwarding strategies which takes input from both FIB and measurements to make
        interest forwarding decisions.  When a node receives an ICN interest packet, it checks
        its CS and PIT to find a matching name; if no match is found, the node records the interest
        in its PIT and forwards the interest to the next hop(s) towards the requested content
        based on the information in its FIB. There exist alternative approaches which
        aim at reducing the amount of state that a nodes must keep, up to fully PIT-less designs
        using packets for keeping state but without changing the overall service model.</t>

      <section title="Generic terms">
        <t><list>
          <t>Information-Centric Networking (ICN): a networking architecture that retrieves data packets as response to interest packets.</t>

          <!--<t>Information-Centric approach (?):</t>-->

          <t>Data packet (same as data, data object, content object packet, data message, named data object, named data): a network-level packet that carries payload, uniquely identified by a name, and is directly secured.</t>

          <t>Interest packet (same as interest, information request): a network-level packet that expresses the request for a data packet using either an exact name or a name prefix. An interest packet may optionally carry a set of additional restrictions (e.g. interest selectors). An interest may  be associated with additional information to facilitate forwarding and can include interest lifetime, hop limit, forwarding hints, labels, etc.  In different ICN designs, the set of additional associated information may vary.</t>

          <!--<t>Location-independence (?)</t>[LZ: I’d suggest to move all location/identifier related stuff into one place, which is not here]-->

          <t>Data packet immutability: after a data packet is created, it cannot change. If the content carried in the data packet is mutable, versioning should be used, so that each version uniquely identifies an immutable instance of the content. This allows disambiguation of coordination in distributed systems.</t>
        </list></t>
      </section>
      
      <section anchor="naming" title="Data naming related terms">
        <t><list>
          <t>Name (aka data name, interest name, content name): a unique identifier of the data packet. ICN name is expressive, flexible, and can be application-specific (akin HTTP URL), a name may encode information about application context, semantics, locations (topological, geographical, hyperbolic, etc.), service name, etc.</t>

          <t>Self-certifying name: a special type of data name that uses a packet ID as data name or uses a packet ID as part of the name</t>

          <t>Packet ID: a unique cryptographic identifier for a data packet. Typically, this is the cryptographic hash digest of a data packet, including its name, payload, meta information, and signature.</t>

          <t>Naming scheme (ICN naming scheme): a convention/agreement/specification for the data packet naming.</t>

          <t>Hierarchically structured naming (same as hierarchical naming, structured naming): the naming scheme that assigns and interprets name as a sequence of labels (name components) with hierarchical structure. A structure provides useful context information for the name.
            <!-- Name or parts of it can be “human-readable” to ease human interaction, but a hierarchical name is ultimately a sequence of ICN node interpretable name components. -->
          </t>

          <t>Flat naming: the naming scheme that assigns and interprets name as a single label (name component) without any internal structure. This can be considered a special (or degenerated) case of structured names. </t>

          <t>Name component (same as name segment): a sequence of octets and optionally a numeric type representing a single label in the hierarchical structured name.</t>

          <t>Name prefix: a sequence of name components from the beginning of a hierarchically structured name.</t>

          <!-- <t>Information Identifiers (?):</t> <t>Location prefix (?):</t> [LZ: I commented these out, to minimize confusions-->

          <t>Segmentation (same as chunking): a process of splitting large application content into a set of uniquely named data packets. When using hierarchically structured name, each created data packet has a common prefix and additional component representing the segment (chunk) number.</t>

          <t>Versioning: a process of assigning a unique name to the revision of the content carried in the data packet. When using a hierarchically structured name, the version of the data packet can be carried in a dedicated name component (e.g., prefix identifies data, unique version component identifies the revision of the data).</t>

          <t>Fragmentation: a process of splitting large data packets into smaller pieces so that they can be transmitted over the link with a smaller MTU size.</t>

          <!-- Naming scalability (?)  [LZ: probably a confusion with routing scalability] -->
        </list></t>

        <t><list>
          <t>Directly secured data packet: a data packet with inherent security properties (authenticity and optionally confidentiality), i.e., the security properties stay with the data packet regardless where it is stored and how it is retrieved.</t>

          <t>Data authenticator (content authenticator): a set of parameters carried in the data packet that is used to verify integrity and authenticity of the data packet. The Data authenticator can include a cryptographic signature (RSA, ECDSA, HMAC, etc.), meta information about the signature (e.g., validity period), and additional information to facilitate signature verification (e.g., key locator, key ID, HMAC tag identifier, etc.)</t>

          <t>Data confidentiality credentials: a set of parameters carried in the data packet that is used to identify how the confidential data can be decrypted by authorized consumers.</t>

          <t>ICN (public) key (same as ICN certificate): a data packet that carries public key or public key certificate as payload and may have additional meta information regarding the public key (e.g., validity period, signature time, etc.). The key belongs to the ICN key owner and can be associated with it implicitly through the name or explicitly through meta information.</t>

          <t>ICN key owner (same as Identity): an entity (user, device, program, program instance, module in the program instance, etc.) that owns the private key that corresponds to the ICN key.</t>

          <t>Key locator (same as ?): Parameter(s) that identify the ICN key, which can be the ICN key name, ICN key prefix, ICN key ID, etc.</t>

          <t>ICN key ID: Packet ID of the ICN (public) key.</t>

          <t>Trust model: a model or framework that defines trust relationships, i.e., which entity (represented by an ICN key) is authorized to sign which data packets.</t>

          <t>ICN key chain (certificate chain): a chain of ICN keys (certificates) wherein each key (certificate) is signed by its predecessor and the head of the chain is a trust anchor, i.e., its authenticity is assumed.</t>

          <t>Trust schema: a formal description of a trust model, e.g., in the form of a set of name-based relationships between data and key names and a set of the trust anchors.</t>

        <t><list>
          <t>Stateful forwarding (same as ICN Data plane, ICN Forwarding): a forwarding process that records incoming interest packets in the PIT and uses the recorded information to forward the retrieved data packets back to the consumer(s).

          <t>Name-based routing: a process of forwarding interest packets using the names in interests to guide the forwarding process</t>

          <t>ICN Pending Interest Table (PIT): a database that records received and not yet satisfied interests with the interfaces from where they were received.

            <t>This document aims at establishing a common understanding about
            a set of scenarios that can be used as a base for the evaluation
            of different information-centric networking (ICN) approaches so
            that they can be tested and compared against each other while
            showcasing their own advantages. Towards this end, we review the
            ICN literature and document scenarios which have been considered
            in previous performance evaluation studies. We discuss a variety
            of aspects that an ICN solution can address. This includes general
            aspects, such as, network efficiency, reduced complexity,
            increased scalability and reliability, mobility support, multicast
            and caching performance, real-time communication efficiency,
            energy consumption frugality, and disruption and delay tolerance.
            We detail ICN-specific aspects as well, such as information

              This memo describes research challenges for Information-Centric Networking (ICN), an approach to evolve the Internet infrastructure to directly support information distribution by introducing uniquely named data as a core Internet principle. Data becomes independent from location, application, storage, and means of transportation, enabling or enhancing a number of desirable features, such as security, user-mobility, multicast and in-network caching. Mechanisms for realizing these benefits is subject of on-going research in the IRTF and elsewhere. This document describes current research challenges in ICN, including naming, security, routing, system scalability, mobility management, wireless networking, transport services, in-network caching, and network management.

              This document considers the consequences of moving the underlying network architecture from the current Internet to an Information- Centric Network (ICN) architecture on video distribution. As most of the traffic in future networks is expected to be video, we consider how to modify the existing video streaming mechanisms. Several important topics related to video distribution over ICN are presented, covering a wide range of scenarios: we look at how to evolve DASH to work over ICN, and leverage the recent ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) standard; we consider layered encoding over ICN; Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mechanisms introduce distinct requirements for video and we look at how to adapt PPSP for ICN; Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) adds delay constraints, and this will create more stringent requirements over ICN as well. As part of the discussion on video, we discuss Digital Rights Management (DRM) in ICN. Finally, in addition to considering how existing mechanisms would be impacted by ICN, this document lists some research issues to design ICN specific video streaming mechanisms.

              This document describes the core concepts of the CCNx architecture and presents a minimum network protocol based on two messages: Interests and Content Objects. It specifies the set of mandatory and optional fields within those messages and describes their behavior and interpretation. This architecture and protocol specification is independent of a specific wire encoding. The protocol also uses a Control message called an InterestReturn, whereby one system can return an Interest message to the previous hop due to an error condition. This indicates to the previous hop that the current system will not respond to the Interest.
